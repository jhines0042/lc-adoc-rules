=== Destiny Deck

The Destiny Deck is a tool for characters in the world of Lost Colonies to use as well as a tool for the players of the larp to use.  It serves as both a roleplaying prop as well as a game effect randomizer.

Seven major arcana, seven element cards, twenty-one spirit cards, and seven spirit court cards.  The cards are valued +0, +1, +1, and +3 respectively for the purpose of random result determination.  Typically a player will pull three cards and add them together to determine the random result- This is referred to in the Rules in other locations as a Destiny Draw.
