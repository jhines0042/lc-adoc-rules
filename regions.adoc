= Regions

Every PC started their life living on the continent of Sobukand.  Sobukand is currently run as a single empire lead by two empresses.  Before the empire was founded however the land was divided into various kingdoms and the borders of these kingdoms at the formation of the empire were essentially preserved.  These former kingdoms are now called provinces in the official documentation of the empire, but for the purpose of Character creation we call them Regions.  Below you will find the relevant information needed for Character creation.  For more detailed information on an individual Region, please see the supplemental Region Guides available on our website.

IMPORTANT: The Continent of Sobukand is in the Southern Hemisphere, so as you go farther south, the climate gets generally colder.

IMPORTANT: When using clothing inspired by a certain time period or people please be respectful of their cultures.  Do not use real world religious or ceremonial clothing as costuming.  

The Regions in our world are similar geographically or climate wise to locations in the real world.  We used those features when designing the Regions to allow us to offer as much variety in clothing options as possible. This also means that we do not need to reinvent the wheel for all costume designs which should lower the barrier to entry for costuming this larp.  The goal is to be inclusive rather than exclusionary. 

However, we must take great care to treat the real world cultures that inspire our Regions with respect.  *We reserve the right to ask you to modify your costuming if there is a perception of disrespect to a real world culture.* A little bit of research can go a long way to avoiding problems of this nature. 

Not sure if your costume might be cultural appropriation? Ask us! We are happy to review pictures of your costume or its components for you and if we aren't sure we can also ask others in the community to get a consensus. We may also have ideas of how to adjust existing pieces to be more appropriate.

= Northern Regions

The Northern Regions of Sobukand are generally warm and full of a wide variety of plant and animal life. The imperial capital city of Casere was located on a spot of land that most would have considered part of Feldland. This location, while technically in the north, was chosen for its proximity to trade routes between north and south and river access on the Micelburn.
